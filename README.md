# RT
This project helped me learn and master the basics of Raytracing along side my team, we spent
so much time working on it to try and render the most amazing computer-generated images we can,
and we succeded in doing so.

### What is RT?
When it comes to render 3 dimensions computer generated images there is 2 possible
approaches: “rasterization”, which is used by almost all graphic engines because of it’s
efficiency and “ray tracing.” The ray tracing method is more extensive and as a result
not adapted to real time but it produces a high degree of visual realism.
This project is nothing but a climax of amazing computer-generated images, Here is some examples :

### How do I use it?

### *Installation*

To generate an executable for this project run make in the root of the project directory. 
This project will only work on MacOS El Capitan/Sierra/HighSierra(maybe) and even then, no promises!

### *Usage*

After running make to generate the RT executable you can run the program with ./RT [scenes/scenefile.cfg]

Enjoy.
